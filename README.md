## ðŸš€ How to Get This Running (Installation for the non-nerds)

Wanna run this on your own machine? Here's the lowdown:

First off, setting this up is super simple. You don't need to mess with complicated configs. Just open `config.php` and you'll see it's basically ready to go. You can change the site name if you want, but that's about it!

1. **Grab the Code**:

1. **Go to the Folder**:

1. **PHP Stuff**: Make sure you have PHP installed (like, version 7.4 or newer, c'mon it's 2025). And you'll need the `php-sqlite` thingy enabled.

1. **Database Setup (Don't freak out, it's easy)**: just drop file in that its auto setup

1. **Fire It Up! (Start the server)**: make sure that you edit details in config

1. **Open in Browser**: Now just open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever address you set up). Boom! You're in.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use This Thing (It's pretty intuitive, trust me)

### Making a New Paste

1. Go to the main page in your browser.

1. Type a **Title** (optional, but good for organization).

1. Dump your code or text into the **Content** box.

1. Pick the **Language** so the syntax highlighting works its magic.

1. Choose when you want it to **Expire**.

1. Hit that **Create Paste** button.

### Checking Out a Paste

- After you create one, it'll take you straight to its unique page.

- Or, just click on any paste in the "Recent Pastes" sidebar.

### Copying Stuff

- On the paste page, there's a "Copy to Clipboard" button. Click it. Done.

### Raw View

- Also on the paste page, hit "View Raw" if you just want the plain text. Good for downloading or just grabbing the pure content.
